# LLM Foundations – Phase 1
This repository documents my Phase-1 learning focused on LLMs, Python for APIs, and cloud fundamentals.
The goal is to build strong execution-level understanding through hands-on practice, not just theory.

### Why this repository
I am building this to develop real-world skills in working with LLM APIs, clean Python code, and professional Git practices.

### What this repo includes 
- Python environment setup
- Git & GitHub workflow
- Small scripts and experiments (in progress)

### Current status
Week-1: LLM - FOUNDATIONS
### What does this project do ?
